-- Block vs Inline Elements:
<h1><h2><p><img>are examples of block elements. Headings consume a line (block) all their own.  Paragraph is placed in it's own block.

<div></div> - Content division element. Generic container to group elements together into an entire block.  Useful for common CSS around the group of elements.


<span></span> - generic inline container. Can format content within a block to have a different style.


Odd assortment of elements:
<hr> - Horizontal rule.  An empty line for spacing.  No closing tag is used for this element.

<br> - Line break to format text how you want it broken up. Can use within a <p></p> to break at certain points

<sup></sup> - Superscript Elevated off the baseline for footnotes. Nest <a> anchor tag for links

<sub></sub> - Subscript Below the baseline such as chemistry 

-- Entity codes:
